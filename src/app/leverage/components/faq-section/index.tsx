        <p>
          The Leverage Suite automates your leveraged trading through DeFi
          lending platforms like Aave V3—no perps, no margin calls, and no
          hidden fees. Each token is fully collateralized, with built-in
          liquidation protection and transparent costs, so you can enjoy
          leverage without worrying about managing constant rebalances or
          liquidation risk.

        question='How do leverage tokens work vs perps?'
        id='faq-tokens-work'
      >
        <p>
          Both leverage tokens and perps offer a way for users to amplify their
          exposure to an asset. However, leverage tokens differ from perps in
          their collateral structure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Perps allow traders to speculate on asset prices without directly
          holding the underlying asset, using collateral (often WETH, WBTC, or
          stablecoins) to open long or short positions with leverage. Traders
          must maintain sufficient margin to avoid liquidation if the market
          moves against them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Leverage tokens are fully collateralized by the underlying asset. For
          example, the ETH3x product supplies WETH to Aave, borrows USDC, and
          swaps it for more WETH. This looping process is repeated until the
          desired leverage is achieved, creating an overcollateralized debt
          position directly tied to the underlying asset’s value.
        </p>
        <p>
          All Index Coop leverage tokens adjust real-time leverage ratios
          through rebalancing within defined bounds. This automated rebalancing
          enables liquidation protection and creates a hands-off experience for
          users.
        </p>
        <p>
          Leverage tokens can also be substantially cheaper than perps because
          the borrow rates on Aave are often significantly lower than the
          typical funding rates on perp platforms.
        </p>
      </FaqItem>
      <FaqItem question='Is there liquidation risk?' id='faq-liquidation-risk'>
        <p>
          Every token in the Leverage Suite automatically rebalances the
          underlying collateralized debt positions on Aave v3 to avoid
          liquidation during volatile periods. Redundant keeper systems monitor
          the current leverage ratio for each token at all times and trigger a
          rebalance if it exceeds the maximum leverage ratio.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another layer of protection is enabled by the ripcord system, which
          allows anyone to trigger a rebalance if the current leverage ratio
          exceeds a predefined ripcord leverage ratio; there is also a 0.25 ETH
          reward for anyone who triggers a ripcord rebalance.

          There is no specific amount of time users should or should not hold

        <p>
          The main factors that will impact leverage token performance include,
          tracking error, volatility drift, rebalancing overheads as well as
          costs and fees compounding over time.

          What is volatility Drift?
          <ul className='list-disc pl-6'>
            <li>
              Volatility drift (sometimes called &quot;volatility decay&quot;)
              is the compounding effect on leveraged products that causes their
              returns to deviate from the underlying asset&apos;s
              performance—beyond what a simple multiplication by the leverage
              factor would suggest. In the context of our tokens, periodic
              adjustments to maintain the respective token&apos;s target
              leverage ratio can magnify price swings, leading to drift. For a
              deeper look, check out our deep dive on{' '}

              The underlying mechanism of the Leverage suite tokens uses DeFi
              lending platform deposits and borrows. Assets deposited accrue
              interest from borrows, while borrowed assets incur interest
              expenses. The difference between these rates is your “cost of
              carry,” which can vary over time—sometimes favorably (if earned
              interest exceeds borrowing costs) and sometimes unfavorably (if
              borrowing costs outpace earned interest), as the underlying
              lending platform&apos;s borrow and earn rates vary.
            </p>
            <p className='mt-2'>
              For example, if ETH2x deposits $1,000 of WETH and borrows $500 of
              USDC, where ETH deposits earn +2% and borrowing USDC costs -5%,
              the resulting net Cost of Carry is -1%.

              While Index Coop doesn&pos;t impose charges, swapping assets
              through DEX pools incurs small fees paid to liquidity providers,
              such as the 0.05% swap fee in Uni v3 WETH/USDC pools. Moreover,
              swaps also entail &quot;price impact,&quot; wherein larger swaps
              lead to higher overall prices paid for buys or lower overall
              prices received for sells, thus gradually reducing the net value
              of the position over time.
