        <p>
          When redeeming a legacy product, a streamlined debt redemption process
          takes place behind the scenes. This ensures that your exit from the
          legacy product is handled in the most cost-effective and efficient
          manner, minimizing any unnecessary steps or fees. Our approach
          guarantees that you maintain full control over your assets while
          seamlessly transitioning out of outdated products.
