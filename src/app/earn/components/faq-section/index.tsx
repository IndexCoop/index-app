          product. This methodology outlines the criteria and processes used to
          select protocols, ensuring that each product aligns with its unique
          objectives.

      <FaqItem question='Are Index Coop yield products rebasing tokens or repricing tokens?'>
        <p>
          All Index Coop yield tokens are repricing tokens, meaning they adjust
          in price to reflect changes in value or yield without altering the
          total supply of tokens.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike rebasing tokens, which change the token supply and can affect
          wallet balances, repricing tokens maintain a constant supply. This
          design simplifies portfolio management and accounting for users.
        </p>
        <p>
          The token price directly reflects the accumulated yield or
          performance, providing a straightforward and transparent understanding
          of the token&apos;s value.
        </p>
      </FaqItem>
      <FaqItem question='What are the fees?'>
        <p>
          Index Coop charges annual fees on yield tokens, which vary depending
          on the product. There are no issuance or redemption fees for yield
          tokens.
        </p>
